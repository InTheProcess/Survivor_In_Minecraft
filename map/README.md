# What is this folder?
In this folder, we store all of the world builds.
# How to use:
First, you need to have [WorldPainter](https://www.worldpainter.net/).<br>
Once you have that, just download the software and run.  To open the world file,<br> go to the top left corner and do the following:

`FILE > Open World`<br>

When uploading a build to github, export it to a Minecraft world and put the 2 in a folder.<br>  Then compress it into a .zip format.  Once completed,
upload the file by the following format:<br> `Survivor_build<build number>`.
